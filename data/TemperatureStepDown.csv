"a This is an example of a vaccination program. Individual programs are highly variable and reflect local conditions, disease prevalence, severity of challenge, and individual preferences.",,,,,
"b The use of M gallisepticum vaccine is regulated or prohibited in some states. SB-1 or MDV301 may be combined with turkey herpesvirus in some areas, or Rispens strain may be used in high-challenge areas. Vaccination for infectious bursal disease, laryngotracheitis, and fowlpox depends on local requirements. Other strains of infectious bronchitis (Connecticut, Arkansas 99, Florida 88, etc) are included in some areas. M gallisepticum and Haemophilus gallinarum (coryza) are used only on infected, multiage premises in some areas.",,,,,
